# Study notes for Algorithm Design
Study notes for Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eve Tardos.  

# Contents and Study Plan
## 1. Introduction
This chapter introduces the stable matching problem among other algorithm problems as a primer into algorithm design and problem solving. It is also one of the reasons why I bought this book in the first place, for I was struggling with understanding the stable mathing problem reading other materials. I think I will make detailed tutorial on this kind of problems and code up something based on this chapter. Will finish the first chapter by the end of November.
